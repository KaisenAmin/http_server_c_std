Hereâ€™s a complete `README.md` for your HTTP server project:
# HTTP Server in C using C_STD Framework

This project is a simple HTTP server implemented in C using the **C_STD** framework. It demonstrates basic server setup, handling client requests, and serving HTTP responses. The project is designed to be a learning resource for C programmers and a demonstration of how to build network-based applications using C.

## Features

- Serves static HTML content over HTTP.
- Handles multiple client connections sequentially.
- Built using the C_STD framework for enhanced C development.
- Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux).

## Requirements

- GCC compiler (ensure it's added to your system's PATH).
- CMake for building the project.
- OpenSSL (for SSL/TLS functionality, if needed).
- **Linux Users**: Ensure you have development libraries installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
  ```

## Build and Run

Follow these steps to build and run the project:

### 1. Clean Previous Builds

Before starting a new build, it's a good practice to clean previous build files:

```bash
rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles
```

### 2. Configure the Project

Use CMake to configure the project with GCC as the compiler:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ ..
```

### 3. Build the Project

Build the project using the following command:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

### 4. Run the Server

After building, run the HTTP server:

```bash
make run
```

If everything is set up correctly, the server will start and listen on `localhost` at port `8051`.

## Usage

### Accessing the Server

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8051
```

You should see a simple HTML page served by the server.

### Handling Client Requests

The server handles GET requests and responds with a basic HTML page. The logic for handling client requests is defined in the `handle_client_request` function in `main.c`.

## Customization

### Changing the Server Port

You can change the server port by modifying the `SERVER_PORT` macro in `main.c`:

```c
#define SERVER_PORT 8051  // Change this to your desired port
```

### Serving Different Content

To serve different content, modify the `response` string in the `handle_client_request` function:

```c
const char* response = 
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
    "Content-Type: text/html\r\n"
    "Connection: close\r\n"
    "\r\n"
    "<!DOCTYPE HTML>"
    "<head><title>Custom Title</title></head>"
    "<body><h1>Custom Content</h1><p>Your content here.</p>"
    "</body>"
    "</html>";
```

### Enabling SSL/TLS

To enable SSL/TLS, you will need to modify the project to include SSL handling in the TCP connection. This involves using OpenSSL and modifying the server to handle SSL handshakes and encrypted communication.
